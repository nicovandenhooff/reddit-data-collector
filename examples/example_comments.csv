funny,hrk2ci1,t3_rxjq43,t1_hrjyuer,False,"I agree, and while I'm at it,  I really believe that we shouldn't be breeding dogs or any animals for our own benefit, especially aesthetic. I believe organizations like the AKC should be outlawed until every animal in shelters is adopted. For Christ's sake, so many breeds suffer greatly because of overbreeding. 

Unfortunately, you'd be surprised at the amount of horses that go to meat markets for slaughter. There are many up for adoption and auction. Those that don't sell at auction go right to the meat market. They are often used as food for other animals. Shit, Forbes says we have all eaten horse meat. That article is quite an eye-opening experience. 

The Scottish Fold cat is a perfect example of humans fucking with animals and screwing them up. It's a mutation that comes along with other mutations which are extremely painful and it's been turned into a breed. Outlawed in Australia, but not in the US. Makes me ashamed to be American, as do the many legal puppy mills.

If you buy a puppy from a store or a disreputable breeder although I can't really imagine there are reputable ones (there are enough shelter dogs that are trained and just as amazing as any purebred) just know that you are supporting a deplorable, inhumane business. You are okay with dogs being kept in cages their entire life, so much so that they are unable to walk, and are only used to give birth to litter after litter after litter. And when they no longer can, they are killed. You are supporting that at least half will not ever make it to market. Half will die from lack of care and disease were they ever get in the back of a tractor trailer. The remaining half will be shipped off. Half of those will live through the trip. The half that make it will be put in cages in a store and of those, a quarter will be will die and be put down before they're ever sold. The ones that are sold, many have diseases and medical issues because they're products of over breeding that cost owners a fortune. That's what you support.

People in heaven can still feel anger, hate for those they percieve as sinners, even if the person is too mentally ill to be in controll of their behavior or sin in a vain attempt to escape from agony, Compassionless, cruel, unjust, self-rightous and ignorant. Where as others can be as wounderful as you would have imagined! It seems beings in heaven are still bound by their egos and dont just automatically, if ever, achieve some significant higher state of conciousness along with some supreme understanding of existense? It also seems god is bound by a non human ego and forsakes enlightenment to keep his status as a god. As for the devil it seems he just blatently hates the good and innocent and loves seeing them suffer horror, yet seems to respect those who show true greatness, like someone who risks their lives to save another or other acts of amazing heroism and i think people like world class musicians along with other artists at a similar level?
I think hell has its own paradise for the greatest of evil people, espeacialy those that worship him as diety(not to be confused with non-theological satanists!) and commit atrocities in his name? Where they can live out any fantasy they want as much as they want? As far as nirvanic realms theres supposedly no being that would prevent you from doing anything or going to any realm you want, if you still have an ego you can be unbound from it but still choose to percieve through it, so you could still have human like experiences that you think would be fun! I would imagine any ego in those realms would be like the perfect, compassionate, harmless, love and joy filled version of your human ego, probably free from negative and destructive emotions? From what ive read if you want to achieve absolute enlightenment you would have to release your ego and all desires and emotions along with it? But you wouldnt experience the emotion of bordom or any other unpleasant emotion as well as enjoyable, you'd just exist in a state of absolute contentment and peace 0% suffering of any form, so again you wouldnt experience even a moment of boredom!?

I've only started really making comics around Feb this year as an outlet for the way the pandemic has affected us all. I've been told by people that I have a funny bone (as I hopefully we all do) and that my art is good enough to show to the world. Didn't really think too much of it but one day I did start drawing a few comics and the reception I got was so nice that I thought why not commit to this. 

Anyways, I guess my opinion is biased as one of the people causing the issues but from what I have observed, the kind of response and discussion I have received posting here has eclipsed what I get at either r/comics or r/webcomics (the latter being basically dead sometimes). I may not be the funniest person over here and there are certainly people who have their humor dialed a certain way but funny is subjective and we are all just trying to find a way to make people laugh. I suppose comics was a way to do that. 

I support this rule if that's what everyone agrees upon, but I rely on the feedback I get here to make my work better the next time around. Heck, I was about to post a comic as I'm typing out this message, but I respect the rules of the subreddit.

The big problem is that *everything* is a shortcut.  Of course the icons on the desktop are a shortcut, but fun fact: the icons in the Start menu are *also shortcuts*.

We could get a command prompt using Windows-R, but that was about it.  *Everything* else just launched Notepad.

We wound up having to modify the system using PowerShell scripts.  (For reasons I don't remember regedit wasn't enough).  It took a couple of hours to get it totally unscrewed.  During that time I alternated between cry-laughing at the absurdity of it all and getting really, really pissed.

pics,hri16gk,t3_rxgsqc,t3_rxgsqc,True,"Here is an interesting excerpt and some background on Café Society (per a NY Post article - ya I know, but whatever - it's still an interesting article)...

&#x200B;

>But downtown, in Greenwich Village, there was another sort of club. It was called Café Society, and while it attracted the swells, it also welcomed unknown artists, struggling musicians, budding writers, out-of-work actors and Communists.  
>  
>Its name was a bit of a joke, since it was the antithesis of its tonier cousins. Billing itself as “the wrong place for the right people” and “the rendezvous of celebs, debs and plebs,” it was one of the first nightclubs in which blacks and whites mixed freely — at a time when even Harlem’s Cotton Club seated blacks at the back of the house.  
>  
>Its founder was Barney Josephson, a shoe salesman from Trenton, NJ. On a trip to Europe, he became enamored of the cabarets in Berlin and Prague, and returned home intent on opening his own. He borrowed $6,000 and took out a lease on the basement at 1 Sheridan Square, whose previous tenant was a speakeasy modeled after a dungeon.  
>  
>Josephson got rid of the shackles and cages and asked some up-and-coming artists — Adolf Dehn, Syd Hoff, John Groth — to cover the walls with murals. He gave them each a $125 chit for food and drinks at the bar.  
>  
>Josephson despised the snobbery of the uptown clubs, and the gangsters and bootleggers who financed them.  
>  
>“Why can’t the nightclub business be legitimate, like shoes?” he once asked a reporter. There would be “no padding of checks” at the Café Society, he said.  
>  
>But there would be good music — the best jazz in the city. Benny Goodman and record producer John Hammond backed him. Hammond lined up an unknown singer named Billie Holiday to open the club. She sang there almost every night for the next nine months, debuting the song “Strange Fruit.”Lena Horne, Sarah Vaughan and Harry Belafonte sang there, too. Jack Gilford, the club’s house comic, introduced his friend Zero Mostel, soon to become Café Society’s leading attraction. Imogene Coca and Carol Channing performed there as well.  
>  
>The club was so popular that Josephson opened a second branch uptown on East 58th Street in 1940. He had plans for a third, but was undone by politics. In 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee subpoenaed his brother Leon about ties to the Communist party. Leon refused to testify, provoking the ire of powerful red-baiting columnists such as Winchell, Dorothy Kilgallen and Westbrook Pegler. They savaged Josephson, implying that anybody who frequented his clubs was probably a Commie and a traitor. Winchell, who favored the Stork Club over Café Society, took to calling it “Café Pink"".  
>  
>Business reportedly plunged by nearly half. Josephson toughed it out for a year, but then closed both branches.  
>  
>The Red Scare was in full swing and Josephson became one of its first victims.  
>  
>He spent the rest of his life running a quiet restaurant in the Village called the Cookery.No politics there — just omelets and burgers.

Hisham Abu Hawash is a native Palestinian imprisoned by Israel for over a year without a charge or trial.

Yesterday, Hisham ended his strike after being close to death when Israel finally agreed to release him next month.

>For 141 days, the 40-year-old refused food from his Israeli jailers to protest being held under so-called administrative detention – prolonged imprisonment without charge or trial.  
>  
>After negotiations that involved Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian Authority officials, including PA intelligence chief Majed Faraj, the Israeli military agreed to release Abu Hawash on 26 February and not renew his detention order.

&#x200B;

>Abu Hawash, a father of five, **was detained by Israel in October 2020. His administrative detention order has been renewed multiple times.**  
>  
>His lawyer said he would remain in the hospital until he recovers his health after an **arduous strike that brought him to the brink of death.**  
>  
>  
>  
>Israel’s use of indefinitely renewable administrative detention is a direct continuation of **British colonial practice**. It **may constitute a war crime**, according to human rights organizations.  
>  
>In 2021, Israel issued almost 1,600 administrative detention orders against Palestinians – most of whom had previously spent years in Israeli prisons – in some cases up to 15 years.  
>  
>Currently, Israel is holding 500 Palestinians in administrative detention.  
>  
>As a collective act of resistance, administrative detainees launched a boycott of Israel’s military court system earlier this week and are refusing to participate in what B’Tselem has described as a “Kafkaesque legal reality.”  
>  
>**Under administrative detention orders, Palestinians are held based on “secret evidence” that neither they nor their attorneys have access to.**  
>  
>Many administrative detainees **resort to hunger strikes because it is the only way to flip the power dynamic** and force Israel into action.

The one that worked with my iPod (somewhat newer model than the above) was CF to 1.8"" ZIF/LIF HDD adapter (such as [this one](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC3NV8)). The adapter is same size and has same mount points as 1.8"" hard drive, so it was a simple drop in replacement.

I did my conversion a while ago, these adapters might be a bit harder to find these days. Also stay within maximum supported capacity of the iPod in question, stuffing in crazy large capacity CF card into an old iPod might not work.",1641440231.0,False,6,False

Also, this model iPod had a small accessory port on the top next to the headphone jack, which is how the iTrip is plugged in. The iTrip was an accessory which allows the iPod to literally broadcast whatever song you're playing over low-power FM radio - perfect for playing your music in your car without wires, in the years before Bluetooth!

Between an incredibly busy period at work and a lot of family / scouting / holiday activities recently, I've had very little time for my retro hobbies. Knowing I shouldn't start anything very deep or complex, this week I turned my attention to a dead iPod 3rd Gen I picked up in a trade a while back. 

The previous owner had let me know that it was totally dead, but threw it in as a bonus item in case I might use it for parts someday. I plugged it into a known-good USB charger with my last remaining 30-pin cable and confirmed that it was totally dead... but something about it kept tickling the back of my brain. This was the model of iPod that was selling like hotcakes when I first started working for Apple back in early 2004, and some mix of my usual retro-obsession + a little personal nostalgia made me want to try resurrecting it. 

Finally, it hit me: this particular model has a funny ""spanning the eras"" quirk: it uses the same 30-pin-to-USB cable that many other iDevices over the years used for syncing to a computer (before Lightning took over, anyway), but in a final bit of heritage from the original 1st-gen iPods, this model will *sync* from USB but will only *charge* if connected to a FireWire charger or computer! I picked up a firewire AC adapter and cable cheap on eBay, and sure enough, the trusty little iPod sprang back to life. I also replaced the internal battery (an easy 15-minute project, thankfully), and I'm happy to report that it's working like a champ... and maybe even better, whoever was the last person to actually use it had pretty good taste in music - there's still a ton of good songs on the tiny internal 15GB hard drive!

pics,hrkivjf,t3_rxlp1r,t3_rxlp1r,True,">Eric Munchel, a pro-Trump rioter who stormed the Capitol building while holding plastic handcuffs, took the restraints from a table inside the Capitol building, prosecutors said in a court filing Wednesday.

>Munchel, who broke into the building with his mom, was labeled ""zip-tie guy"" after he was photographed barreling down the Senate chamber holding the restraints. His appearance raised questions about whether the insurrectionists who sought to stop Congress from counting Electoral College votes on January 6 also intended to take lawmakers hostage.

>But according to the new filing, Munchel and his mother took the handcuffs from within the Capitol building - apparently to ensure the Capitol Police couldn't use them on the insurrectionists - rather than bring them in when they initially breached the building.

I'm not scared of a terrorist attack when I walk through London, a lifetime of living through them has shown me that there's nothing scary about these people.  They're so powerless all they can do is try to bomb innocent people or rush an empty office holding a baseball bat.

No, I'm far more scared of the guy approaching me at night and asking if I have any loose change or could I light his cigarette.

Fuck these so-called ""terrorists"".  Laugh and point at them, ridicule them, belittle them, embarrass them, humiliate them.  Don't be scared of them and their kind.

Living in fear of dickheads like this means that they win, even if they end up in jail.

Look at it this way - if you bring a baseball bat into a bank and use the threat of force to obtain the money in the drawer, you are a bank robber.

If you walk into a bank empty handed but snatch up an unattended cane or umbrella and then use the threat of force to obtain the money in the drawer, well then you are also a bank robber.

Homie showed up in his tacticool gear intent on detaining/threatening members of Congress with the desired effect of preventing those members from completing their official duties.

> Officer Eugene Goodman: The Storming of The Capitol, Washington, D.C., January 6, 2020

Per [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goodman_(police_officer\)):

> On January 6, 2021, supporters of Donald Trump breached the United States Capitol building, Goodman, unaccompanied by other officers, confronted them. He has been cited for heroism in baiting and diverting the crowd away from the Senate chamber in the minutes before the chamber could be safely evacuated. As the crowd reached a landing from which there was an unimpeded path to the Senate chamber, Goodman pushed the lead person, Doug Jensen, and then retreated away from the chamber. One report described his actions as follows:

> In short, he tricked them, willingly becoming the rabbit to their wolf pack, pulling them away from the chambers where armed officers were waiting, avoiding tragedy and saving lives. Lives which include their own.

> Those present at the time of the event, including Democratic and Republican politicians and members of the press, praised Goodman for his quick thinking and brave actions. Republican Senator Ben Sasse credited Goodman with having ""single-handedly prevented untold bloodshed"". Goodman's former unit, the XVIII Airborne Corps, issued a statement commending his valor and saying that he ""was a hero long before last Wednesday"".

> Goodman's actions were captured in video footage taken by HuffPost reporter Igor Bobic. Bobic's footage of Goodman went viral, receiving more than 10 million views. A second video of Goodman's confrontation with the crowd was published by ProPublica on January 15. Goodman's actions have been credited with saving the lives of the Senators who, at the time, remained inside the chamber.

> A video released on February 10, 2021, during the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, showed Goodman leading Senator Mitt Romney away from the rioters during the January 6 attack.

1. There was also a ton of peaceful protesting, as well as a messy mixture of approaches
2. The threat to safety of the people living in the city was way more frequently from right-wing protestors who bussed in looking for a fight, or cops who used too much force or abused the rights of protestors (a fundamental issue the protests were about...). Like, as a person living here, those were the things that scared me, not the protestors, not antifa.
3. There were tons of lies spread about leftist protests. Concrete milkshakes, saying Portland was burning or destroyed, blaming antifa for fights the proud boys instigated... list goes on.

pics,hrk1uhc,t3_rxlp1r,t1_hrj2ql1,False,"For redhats and similar folk, LITERALLY EVERYTHING is us vs. them. There's no right or wrong, no logic, no principles, just us vs. them. If you're ""us"" then whatever you did (including attempting a coup) is good, if you're ""them"", then whatever you did was bad, like protesting police brutality or wearing a mask to protect your fellow citizens.

Not only is this all you need to understand right-wing thinking today, if you try to think BEYOND this, nothing will make any sense. The only framework that explains this pattern is simple, unadulterated tribalism.

Case in point: this is why they criticize Biden for wearing a mask and AOC for not wearing a mask ON THE SAME DAY ON THE SAME CHANNEL. The mask doesn't matter, they're criticizing them for being THEM and not US.

Right wing leaders exploit this effect to effect or prevent their preferred policy, (or just grift like hell like Shapiro or Jones) right wing followers apparently don't notice or don't care that it works this way, they just enjoy tribal feels I guess, who knows.

Their morality and logic are 100% tribal, 0% principles or facts. Keep in mind that they've shown this effect in polls as well. For right-wingers, it's much more important that the right person is behind the policy, than what the policy IS.

For what it's worth, anyone triggered by this comment: I don't think the people in question can really help it unless they're completely separated from right-wing (social) media for a good while. It's a lot like how casinos use unpatched exploits (to use a computer metaphor) in the human brain for profit (and therefore have to be heavily regulated).  Gambling addiction is real, equally so is the potential for fear and uncertainty to drive behavior, even irrational and destructive behavior.

I think this whole situation is because people are afraid (in many cases rightly, tons of things in this country are totally fucked, right-wing leaders also go to extreme effort to INVENT things to be afraid of like CRT or... caravans, or kneeling football players, or whatever) and the human instinct is to huddle up with your tribe against threats.

If you feel fear about political subjects (almost impossible not to these days) and you are unable to self-soothe rationally, then you're ripe for the picking by fearmongering politicians who claim they're part of YOUR tribe. However, in a 2-party democratic system, the main way to keep power using this tactic is to make EVERYONE OUTSIDE OF YOUR TRIBE out to be the threat. And... this is exactly what they've been doing. The problem is the response to the ""threat"" is going beyond voting and verging on starting a civil war.  


I'd say this tendency to brazenly exploit fear has been in place since 9/11 and probably before that, but even then it was dressed up in some other principle. Fighting terrorism, or fiscal responsibility, even ""death panels"" had some flaky veneer of rationality. Today it's literally just devolved into ""democrats are evil communists who must be defeated"" with absolutely no rational explanation even half-attempted.",1641509381.0,False,23,False

But they attacked civilian targets.  People who had nothing to do with anything.  After a while, you just stopped caring because you couldn't predict it, do anything about it, and what they were doing was pointless.

We rendered them moot.  Bomb London today and watch.  Everyone gets the message on their phone.  Sure, the people in danger react and get the fuck out.  Everyone else?  ""Oh, for fuck's sake, they're going to stop the trains now and I'll never get a cab, how the fuck am I supposed to get home tonight?""  I've literally see it happen on multiple occasions.  Nobody is going ""Oh, the sheer horror!  We must stop these people!"".

I find it strange how we can also, simultaneously, protect a woman's supposed 'right' to terminate her unborn child. It sounds like a contradiction in terms. 

Abortion is the removal of a living entity!

The unborn child is made up of multiple human cells and has human DNA separate & distinct from that of its mother. The child is wholly different from its mother. It is human life by all possible definitions. It is a human being and therefore deserves the same rights as any other human being.

You seem to be making the argument that the ZEF is like a parasite. The mother (or host as she is sometimes referred to) created the dependent life in question. The unborn child is NOT a parasite! It did not find a random host to feed on! The unborn child's life and its 'right-to-life' were NOT without the expressed consent of the mother. The mother created that new life willingly, willfully, 'on her own accord' & fully aware of the possible outcome.

I believe that a woman should have the absolute right in deciding whether or not to CREATE new life. In contrast, I believe that a woman should NOT have the absolute right in deciding whether or not to END that same newly created (& separate) life that is 'alive' inside of her.

Abortion ends the life of the unborn child... The mother's offspring. It is akin to murder. There was a story near where I lived where a father killed his 4 and 6-year-old daughters on Christmas day (https://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.ctvnews.ca/local/british-columbia/2019/12/19/1_4737124.html).

>Pregnancy is already an extreme physical and emotional stress...

Abortion is also ""an extreme physical and emotional stress""... I don't think one is more or less stressful than the other. Not enough is said about the mental effects it has. My mother, over 50 years later, still ponders over what her child would have been like had it been born. It's almost akin to a miscarriage... Perhaps worse.

You misunderstand, I am calling the one extra day the mild inconvenience. The tragedy was the mother choosing not to have an abortion early on, and instead choosing to carry the brainless child to the day before birth.

>late-term abortions (>24 weeks) make up only 1% of US abortions. I feel it would be a rare person to get to that stage for whom the baby isn't wanted and wished for, apart from the obvious rape/abuse/no access to abortion until then.

Then perhaps what is needed is an exception process. If the unborn child has a heartbeat/brain activity (whatever objective measure is decided), then a panel of doctors and judges (or some other group of socially-power-endowed people with knowledge/expertise on the medical *and* moral side of things).

An issue for pro-lifers, and even those of us who think abortion should be legal and readily available, are the minority of women who will abuse the legality of abortion. Those who after a fight with their partner, get an abortion to spite them. Those who use abortion as contraception. Those deranged activists who celebrate abortions. They are the target for the vast majority of people calling for more restrictions on abortion - not rape victims, not women carrying children with deformities, etc.

It is not beyond the wit of man to come up with ways to target one group and not the other.

My final point often gets called sex-negative or victim blaming or anti-woman, but it's none of those things - it is basic reason: if you don't want a baby, don't have sex. This applies to both men and women. If you don't want a hangover, don't drink. If you don't want to get fat, don't eat so much.

I think there's a big difference between a woman who wants an abortion because she was raped and/or because her country does not have an adequate foster system versus, say, a woman who did it because she wanted a boy instead of a girl or because she doesn't want a child with down syndrome.

And I would agree that, in order to ban abortion, there needs to be better access to contraceptives. I would add that, in my opinion, before the government starts placing abortion bans in place, they need to take care of living people. For example, in some cases it is possible to know before birth if a child is going to be disabled. I would expect that the decision on whether or not to terminate that pregnancy would rely heavily on her country's healthcare and social security programs. I also think that, in order to ban abortion, there has to be adequate foster care, etc.

With what I know about abortion, I would not make any blanket statements as to whether or not it should be legal. However, I do think there are a lot more nuances to the discussion than whether or not the sex was consensual, and I think there are too many nuances for a government to take all of them into consideration when deciding when to ban abortions.

As for the ""two wrongs don't make a right"" argument, I would have to disagree. I agree that two wrongs don't make a right, however, I would not necessarily say abortion is always wrong. Pregnancy is already an extreme physical and emotional stress (generally- of course some are easier or harder than others.) In the case of sexual assault, it is extremely traumatic, and I do not think it is right for the government to participate in traumatizing its citizens like this.

1. a woman having a period with a fertilized egg is not murder
2. aborting a baby the day before it would be born is murder

The issue is that we don't agree at what point in between the unborn child deserves human rights. Science can't answer this question for us, it's a philosophical/moral question - and as such very subjective.

The idea that (using the UK limits for simplicity) a foetus at 23 weeks 6 days and 23 hours old is in any way significantly different from a 24 week old, is so clearly wrong as to be laughable. Same applies for the age requirement for drinking or gambling or such. It's one area that I actually think the pro-life crowd have a better argument: a heartbeat or brain activity makes far more sense than an arbitrary number of days since conception.

The other thing that I believe the pro-choice crowd get wrong is destigmatising or even celebrating abortion. Abortion (in most cases) is the lesser of two evils, but it is still evil/bad. You are having to kill *something*, because of your decision to have sex. As above, that *something* is not yet a legal person, but it would become one if you didn't abort/kill it.

I believe the vast majority of the population want abortion to be legal (most certainly in cases of incest, rape, deformities, or when the mother's life is in danger), with stringent restrictions and a social stigma. I believe that pushing for fewer restrictions, or to destigmatise abortion is a losing strategy to keeping abortion legal - same way pushing for seizing the means of production is the enemy of getting corporations to pay more tax. By going to the logical extreme (or standing shoulder to shoulder with those extremists), you alienate the majority of the public.

The only rationale given to ""Pro-Life"" is religion or ignorance - not a fair representation, and patronizing.  This statement ignores the simple philosophical consideration of where life begins, which is central and obvious.

Also, it's not great that the mods posted links to arguments for one side only.  (Although I'm not going to search for a counter-balance article at the moment.)

Abortion is a challenging issue, and weighing in on it takes balance and judgment.  We should *not* pretend that there is a legitimate disagreement when there is none - i.e. climate change.  It is perfectly okay to describe a position as totally stupid, if it really is so.

It is not acceptable to ignore disagreement when it is legitimate, attributing one side to ""ignorance"", when that is not a good diagnosis.  Remember, there are dumb people on both sides of most debates - pointing them out is a waste of time (and an ad hominem).

The crux of the debate is around the phrase *her body*. Pro-choice people believe that an abortion is something the woman does to her own body. Pro-life people believe that it's something she does to someone else's body. They believe that the fetus is a separate person, deserving like any other person of having their human rights protected by the government.

This is why court cases generally revolve around the question of fetal viability. There has to exist some line where the fetus changes from ""part of the mother's body"" into ""a human"", and I don't think you'll find many people who'll say that that line is the exact moment of birth. *Roe* defined it as the third trimester; *Casey* defined it as viability; extreme anti-abortionists believe it's the moment of conception. Republican lawmakers have been trying for years to define it as various arbitrary milestones like when the fetus can respond to pain or when a heartbeat can be detected.

It's a difficult and messy question, since there's no single moment you can point to and say ""this is when life begins"", and because both sides are so entrenched at this point that the conversation is loaded with buzzwords and political grandstanding more than any attempt at rational argument.

So, all in all, the government being able to dictate what people do with their bodies is pretty necessary. And trying to call it misogynistic is hard to argue (though I agree that is is) because the laws would also forbid men from getting abortions.",1640577607.0,False,1,False

They were left abandoned in the senate building on a table in the hallway outside the chamber by the Capitol Police, and briefly looted by rioters on the scene, who later abandoned them after noting the bad optics. Munchel and his mother had brought several unspecified weapons- ""not guns""- in a backpack that they chose to stash outside the building before entering, believing they could avoid criminal charges by not entering the building armed.

There is no way these people were serious. They had no guns. And much of the footage released oc the chamber was just a few people casually strolling around with Capitol Police calmly asking them to leave.

Except, they make up less than 5% of all the totality of abortions. I don't think the exception to the rule should be the largest factor in making up the rule.

Whilst I agree with the sentiment, and basic idea that pregnancy as a result of rape is massively different to pregnancy by voluntary sex, I think it is interesting and important that you're talking %.

Blackstone's ratio is one of the principles of common law, ""It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer."" - meaning that the exceptions must be *at least* 10% or fewer of the cases. This is also why the feminist argument about the low conviction rate of rape accusations is no argument at all - presumption of innocence, and the standard for conviction being beyond reasonable doubt are fundamental cornerstones of justice.

I would suggest that a compromise would be that in order to qualify for an abortion due to rape, the woman must both file a police report and sworn affidavit - as opposed to simply saying to the medical team that they were raped. That way, if the woman is provably lying, they will be punished for wasting police time and perjury - but if there simply isn't enough evidence for conviction (as there often isn't) then there is no punishment.

>""Human life is a living entity with human DNA."" I believe that the existence of human life (or unborn human child) happens at conception.

That is when human life begins, the question really should be ""when does this new human life gain human rights? (i.e. personhood)"" - if you hold it begins at conception, that means Plan B is murder. That means a miscarriage is involuntary manslaughter . I don't believe either of these should be the case.",1639906501.0,False,3,False
pics,hpaxk6h,t3_rh25ex,t1_hp547k3,False,"In my eyes, being raped was just an example, it isn't the only exception- there are women who get abortions because they cannot care for their children and their country's foster care system is completely inadequate. There are women who get them because they can get pregnant, but it's too risky for then to carry it to term. There are girls who are too young to have children (some girls can get pregnant at 10 years old, but that's just not safe- just because their uterus can form a baby does not mean their body is fully ready to support it. There is an instance of a girl giving birth at 5 years old. It may not be common, but it does happen.) There are some women who are addicts and cannot quit, but would rather not subject their child to fetal alcohol syndrome (and ""just quitting drinking"" isn't always an option.) There are some women who are getting too old to safely have children, there are men whose pregnancies will interrupt gender transition, there are some people with a family or personal history of pregnancy complications, and there are so many more reasons why someone may seek an abortion. I think the primary response to all of these should be better contraceptive access and sex education- I'm no pro abortion, I want that on the table. However, even in instances where contraceptives are available, there are times they fail, and I think abortion should be available. I think abortion should be the last possible resort, but I think it should be available.

There was a post I saw in this sub. It was the photo of a memorial for a woman who died of septic shock because she was miscarrying, but denied an abortion while the fetus still had a heartbeat. I think abortion should be available for women like her.

I think abortion should not be common. I think it should be a last possible resort. I think we would see significantly less demand for abortions if we had better  foster care, more protections for sexual abuse victims, better sexual education, more contraceptive access, more accessible healthcare for pregnant women and addicts, etc.- however, I think abortion is such a complex topic that any kind of blanket ban is going to fail to take *something* into consideration. And, more than anything, I think it's important to remember that people who are determined enough to have abortions will get them one way or another and I would much rather have those people go to clinics than do it with a coat hanger.

I think fetuses have value as living creatures; however, in the cases where an abortion is neccessary, I think consciousness adds a level of humanness that fetuses don't have. That is why I think we should try and *prevent* abortions. They should be a last case resort for when the pregnancy is threatening the mother's well being or when the child will have a miserable standard of living should they be born.

I think comparing a fetus to an amoeba is unfair- yes both are life in the scientific sense, but not in the philosophical sense. If a fetus, an adult human, and an ameoba have the same value, that would make hand sanitizer a form of murder, because viruses are as well.

As I've noted, you can't actually abort when you get that late (38-39 weeks), and they have to induce labor. Also, defects of the complex nervous system often aren't spotted until relatively late in pregnancy because it's the *complex* nervous system--it develops relatively late in an of itself.

> ...the minority of women who will abuse the legality of abortion. Those who after a fight with their partner, get an abortion to spite them. Those who use abortion as contraception. Those deranged activists who celebrate abortions.

Too much here to really discuss, but 1) while I *do* know there are callous women in the world, their reason for having an abortion is IMO no one's business, and 2) I don't agree that all the people you list are ""abusing"" the availability of abortion.

> They are the target for the vast majority of people calling for more restrictions on abortion - not rape victims, not women carrying children with deformities, etc.

At least in American discussions about this, I've noticed that the predominant framing of these things is ""it's murder"" and that women who want abortions *in general* are callous. Contraception and sex education are also targeted, so that woman not only don't have access to ways to prevent pregnancy, but to know they *can* prevent it. This also combines with healthcare access in general, as targeted by the American right-wing.

> if you don't want a baby, don't have sex

I do, in fact, think this is an anti-women talking point. For one, contraceptives *fail*, even the best ones: I have an IUD, but still a very very very very rare chance of getting pregnant with an ectopic pregnancy, which is fatal for both fetus and the person carrying it.

Two, [look at the demographics of women getting abortions](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/characteristics-us-abortion-patients-2014#) in the US. 59% of them had already given birth, so they're hardly callous about having children. But, furthermore:

> In 2014, three-fourths of abortion patients were low income—49% living at less than the federal poverty level, and 26% living at 100–199% of the poverty level.
> 
> ...
> 
> Abortion patients were less likely to have no health insurance coverage in 2014 than in 2008 (28% vs. 34%), likely because of the Affordable Care Act. Thirty-five percent of patients had Medicaid coverage...

Access to healthcare (incl. contraception) and *having money* allow people to avoid abortions. Studies indicate [40% of women](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6874-13-29) in the US seek an abortion for financial reasons (and 29% have the reason that they need to focus on their other children). When you say ""don't have sex"" to what is basically a bunch of poorer women, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Partner related reasons accounted for 31% of abortions in the above study, so you know at least 31% of them have (or have had) a partner, and probably more.

It feels extremely callous to me to say ""do not have sex with your partner, even with contraception, if you aren't 100 prepared for a baby"" to, well, pretty much every non-lesbian woman on Earth. No one is ever 100% prepared for these things and there's always a small chance of pregnancy--just as there's a chance of injury and worse every time you choose to drive a car.

Guys, it's a midterm year. Start fundraising and **getting out the vote.** Vote every Republican fascist sympathizer out.

**Edit**: I really don't like little gaslighting incels too cowardly to be upfront about their opinions.

Below you'll find responses of right-wing extremists (#1 Domestic Terror threat, per the FBI by the way) and apologists attempting to downplay the significance of the events of January 6th. You see it's a real thorn in the sides of bigots and Republicans alike and will be (justifiably) used against them for every election hereon and they know it. 

The claim: ""A bunch of fat rednecks bum-rushed the Capitol with flags and red hats. 1 dumb hick got shot. Then they all read a tweet, and left. Sorry, there was nothing close about that.""

The user has yet to respond with ANY evidence supporting his downplaying of the events, but I will give many sources from a wide variety of experts... **And NOWHERE will you find them downplaying it with the likes of, ""Sorry, there was nothing close about that.""**:


""Hang Mike Pence""

""Stop the Steal""

""There's the big jew, let's get him.""

Just a few highlights of a day of right-wing extremists who joined together and from taking the dog-whistles of Trump, trespassed their way to the Capitol, stomping, beating, crushing, spraying the so-called ""Blue Lives"" they pretended to care for in the preceding months.

They brought zip-ties; they built literal gallows on the grounds. Pipe bombs stashed nearby. All the while their mob-mentality where no rugged individualist there thought for themselves but for what the collective heard mentality continued pushing deeper into the Capitol. That would leave one fool who lapped up the propaganda with a bullet in her neck. 

They fucked around; they found out. The cowards backed off quickly when confronted with a deadly defense.

The entire basis of the march was to stop a fair, genuine democratically-held election after poor sports who lost fair-and-square cried foul. Turns out, more flags don't mean more votes. They wanted to stop the peaceful transition of power. The mob sought Democratic members of the house, as well as Mik Pence with no indication they'd be peaceful about it.

Given the lack of effective defense of the Capitol, what could have happened if they reached Pelosi? If they reached Mike Pence? With their zip-ties, it seemed evident they were considering holding members hostage in order to reinstate President Trump. That of course would be textbook fascism. After all, they were defending the Big Lie all over again... Now think about that. Think about the consequences of undermining faith in genuine elections, absent of ZERO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE, let alone an ounce of proof.

There, now that's a good start. Among some o Surely this will spark good-faith discussions, am I right? A whole swath of experts from counter-terrorist watchdogs, professors of social and academic backgrounds, present-day congressional leaders in relevant house committee fields, the highest levels of our Department of Justice...

""There's the big jew, let's get him.""

Just a few highlights of a day of right-wing extremists who joined together and from taking the dog-whistles of Trump, trespassed their way to the Capitol, stomping, beating, crushing, spraying the so-called ""Blue Lives"" they pretended to care for in the preceding months.

They brought zip-ties; they built literal gallows on the grounds. Pipe bombs stashed nearby. All the while their mob-mentality where no rugged individualist there thought for themselves but for what the collective heard mentality continued pushing deeper into the Capitol. That would leave one fool who lapped up the propaganda with a bullet in her neck. 

They fucked around; they found out. The cowards backed off quickly when confronted with a deadly defense.

The entire basis of the march was to stop a fair, genuine democratically-held election after poor sports who lost fair-and-square cried foul. Turns out, more flags don't mean more votes. They wanted to stop the peaceful transition of power. The mob sought Democratic members of the house, as well as Mik Pence with no indication they'd be peaceful about it.

Given the lack of effective defense of the Capitol, what could have happened if they reached Pelosi? If they reached Mike Pence? With their zip-ties, it seemed evident they were considering holding members hostage in order to reinstate President Trump. That of course would be textbook fascism. After all, they were defending the Big Lie all over again... Now think about that. Think about the consequences of undermining faith in genuine elections, absent of ZERO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE, let alone an ounce of proof.

I frankly don’t care if the TV is treating them the same.  I care if their ability to walk free or be in jail is the same.  It speaks volumes of our country that people see the former as somehow more important than the latter because they’re on TV more...

On April 19, 2021, the office of the chief medical examiner of the District of Columbia, Dr. Francisco J. Diaz, reported that the manner of death was natural and the cause of death was ""acute brainstem and cerebellar infarcts due to acute basilar artery thrombosis"" (two strokes at the base of the brain stem caused by an artery clot). Diaz told the Washington Post that there was no evidence that Sicknick had an allergic reaction to chemicals or was otherwise injured, but stated that ""all that transpired played a role in his condition."" The actual autopsy report has not been released to the public. The medical examiner's office did not say why it took more than 100 days to release the results of that autopsy.  
  
The medical examiner's determination rendered murder charges unlikely. Because stress and traumatic events can lead to a stroke, some neurologists and other experts questioned the medical examiner's classification of the manner of death as natural: Dr. Cyril Wecht, a forensic pathologist, said that Sicknick's manner of death could have been classified as accidental, a homicide, or undetermined.  
  
After the ruling, the Capitol Police issued a statement saying that the ruling ""does not change the fact Officer Brian Sicknick died in the line of duty, courageously defending Congress and the Capitol.""

Pepe Mujica, one of Uruguay's ex presidents, is an example of a leader of the kind the US hasn't had in decades, standing up for the working class while making the countries economy grow exponentially. Uruguay's current president's policies during the pandemic have guaranteed it had very few cases and even fewer deaths, dealing with the situation much better than many other developed countries. Likewise, Argentina's ex-president Cristina Kirchner kept the health of the people prioritized during this crisis and is an example world wide when it comes to fighting covid.

Please, do not speak so ignorantly about other people's cultures and countries. That is exactly the sort of thing Trump did so frequently and I would like to believe the people of the US have moved past this man's barbaric way of thinking.",1641483867.0,False,-6,False

>When a dependable lifelong belief set is presented with contradictory facts, what happens is the Backfire Effect. Academic research has found that merely presenting info that challenges our worldview serves only to harden those previous positions. Not only aren’t our beliefs “corrected” by fact checking, but the attempt at “correction actually increases misperceptions.”

>Persuasion research has a long history in psychology but also in political science, sociology, and communication studies with a tradition spanning more than five decades (O'Keefe, 2016). Despite potential inconsistencies and controversies, decades of persuasion research generally seem to converge on the following points: (1) persuasion is ubiquitous, found in many areas of our life and used by many for professional, commercial, political, but even activist purposes (Perloff, 2021); (2) resistance to persuasion requires self-regulation and effort (Burkley, 2008; Wheeler et al., 2007) and is decreased when people are distracted (Baron et al., 1973; Rosenblatt, 1966; but see also Haaland & Venkatesan, 1968; Petty et al., 1976 where distraction failed to increase yielding to persuasion). Specific persuasion theories and studies even support the idea that resistance to persuasion entails an active mental counterarguing process to avoid being swayed by persuasive communications (Brandt, 1979; Keating & Brock, 1974; Osterhouse & Brock, 1970).  
**Regardless of the exact model, theory, or supposed mechanism involved in resistance to persuasion, research suggests that yielding to persuasion is cognitively easier than resisting it**. Given that persuasion refers to changing recipients' mental states (especially attitudes; O'Keefe, 2016), these findings generally suggest that citizens are more prone to yielding than to resisting misinformation-based persuasion attempts. Obviously, not all political misinformation is persuasive in nature (cf. misinformation that is unintentionally spread by people who genuinely believe it). Hence, findings from persuasion research may not provide sufficient ground to infer that people are generally prone to misinformation. **However, something more general about human cognition seems to make people believe information that is available in their environment.**",1641499062.0,False,2,False

The original flag of the confederacy was a circle of stars representing the secessionist states and three lines of alternating red-white-red. 

After first Manassas (Bill Run) the confusion between that flag and the flag of the US was brought to light and so a second flag was commissioned. 

This flag bore the familiar stars and bars we equate to the confederacy in the upper left hand corner on a field of white.  The stars and bars of the “battle flag” was originated yes as a naval flag but was also adopted by the Army of Northern Virginia as their battle standard. 

The second flag of the confederacy, because of the white background was eventually mistaken as surrender flags so they modified it a 3rd time to bear a red tip at the very end.  This one was known as the blood stained banner.

At other events the same people flying Confederate, Trump, and Thin Blue Line flags are also proudly flying Nazi flags.  
  
They are radicalized right-wing extremists and domestic terrorists. They are no different from Al Qaeda or the Irish Republican Army. They have conspired to kidnap sitting elected officials at the state and federal level. They have violently assaulted our nation's capitol literally making members of Congress run for their lives. They stated the intent to kidnap, rape, and murder elected representatives - which included an explicit threat to hang the Vice President. They beat and murdered cops while being ushered in and celebrated by fellow traitors among the Capitol Police who took selfies with them.   
  
And yet the Biden Administration's Justice Department, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security have been going soft on investigating, prosecuting, and sentencing those who attacked the Capitol - convicting them of mere misdemeanors - and have not indicted a single elected official who was part of the conspiracy behind the attempted coup - or publicly called for the violence in the days proceeding and on the day of the attack. Democrats didn't even enforce subpoenas during Trump's impeachment trials. They made a great show of concern - but they never once have actually moved to exercise any of their real power against this ongoing treason.   
       
Not too many decades ago these same traitors would have been arrested, indicted, and either hanged or given the electric chair like Julius and Ethel Rosenberg - who sold nuclear secrets to the Soviets. Eisenhower fought the Nazis in WW2 - he didn't court them and tell them to attack congress if he lost the election.   

As far as I'm concerned - Biden is complicit in this travesty and his deliberate inaction is ensuring it will happen again in 2022 and 2024 - or worse.  
  
We are going to see widespread bombings of state and federal buildings, and shootings at polling locations by right wing extremists if corrective action is not taken by the current administration. But I suspect that's what the DNC wants - to further the escalating crisis as a lever they can use to gain power - just like Biden did.

pics,hrgxxvb,t3_rx65w5,t3_rx65w5,True,"I work at a news station in Los Angeles and I also covered extremism and anti-vaccine, anti-mask rallies in Los Angeles for about nine months leading up to this. I was there the day the biggest vaccine site in the nation got shut down for two hours because of anti-vaccine protesters. I saw this shit for months. It is baffling to me that anyone was surprised.

On the 6th, I was off from my job at the station but I headed downtown to cover a Stop the Steal protest on my own time. By now I knew a lot of the local guys in town and they didn't like me much, but most of them knew I was there to document, not to be a menace. I was tolerated as a result of the long hours and many months I spent getting to know those people.

But that day, it really and truly did not matter.

I will genuinely never forget how frightening, how anxiety-inducing, how painful that day was. My phone would not stop dinging with emails coming down from network and Slack messages about my team trying to grapple with how to communicate what was happening to the public. The videos circulating on Twitter were horrifying. How can you even begin to describe it? Nobody knew where to begin.

My journalist friends were all texting each other, frantically making sure we were all alive and unharmed. I was chased out of a rally for the first time in my career as a journalist. I've been threatened a lot, but this time, staying would have put me at physical risk. Once everyone there knew I was a journalist (I wasn't trying to hide it, but I also wasn't making a scene), a group of about 30 people pointed at me, shouted, chanted, and a bunch of armed men moved towards me until I left. I'm a 5'3'' blonde chick. I pose no threat beyond the press badge I wear and the camera I carry. I think every other journalist covering the event got chased out as well.

I've experienced a lot of scary days covering that beat, but that was by far the scariest. It was an awful day. I struggle to look back on it without triggering my PTSD. I am not looking forward to the memories today will bring back.

It’s not as simple as “Georgia segregated proms” as in it was enforced as a rule. A private prom and a public prom were both organized by students. Students were able to choose if they wanted to go to one or the other. Obviously you can see the construct in *private* vs *public* but the students were allowed to choose and were not forced to hold multiple proms.  I’m not defending it, I thought it was stupid, but I just like to add some extra info cause that sentence is just a tad misleading.

Edit: So I’ve actually contacted two friends who were in different regions of Georgia to ask them what their high schools did. So far, the only schools that I personally know of that had more than one prom are the two schools that were in my county. If anyone else from Georgia or any state had a similar situation with their prom(s), please chime in cause now I’m curious as to where else this is happening/happened.

pics,hrindhf,t3_rxdf9r,t1_hrigkmt,False,"Yeah but already by 1930 they were mostly the immigrants' kids and grandkids. The Germans start arriving en masse around when the Irish did, squarely in the mid-19th century.

Texas in particular had a lot of German immigration (compared to the big waves in the late 1840s to the Upper Midwest). As you probably know, a lot of Germans moved to Mexico as well (how do you think the accordion got into the mariachi bands), of which Texas had recently been a part.

Since Germany didn't exist, per se, until the 1870s, it missed most of the big scramble for empire. But it was rich and industrializing right behind Britain and it had lots and lots of people. So large groups of Germans (or small groups of wealthy germans) often simply banded together and bought up marginal lands in the cheaper part of other empires. This is why Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico all had large German populations. Basically, the Spanish and Portuguese empires were run-down enough that Germans could affordably buy up large town areas and build little German enclaves.

Anyway this is a long way of saying this is also a feature of Texas German immigration in the 19th Century. Texas was both recently Mexico (so already the kind of territory the Germans were comfortable moving to) and a very empty part of the United States, so you get lots of wholesale group immigration onto commonly bought land. This is somewhat different than, say, the German immigration to the Midwest, which followed a more traditional families-following-each-other-to-the-same-area-but-not-buying-a-whole-town-at-once daisy chain style of immigration.",1641490882.0,False,12,False
