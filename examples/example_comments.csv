If you can't figure out how to do something original, the follow the example of the James Bond series and continue the fucking story. Don't just do the same story over and over and over and over.

funny,i0hip1a,t3_td375v,t3_td375v,True,"It‚Äôs interesting this is just now being mentioned. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôm hearing of it on Reddit, at least.

A few months ago, I went back to the theaters for the first time since covid hit. The movie I watched was extremely dim and I thought maybe it was just my eyes. But then I went to a completely different theater with a friend of mine, and he confirmed that he definitely felt the screen was too dim during the film as well.

We‚Äôve since watched two more films together - one on the IMAX screen and one in the same theater we usually go to. Both of those screens were dim. A regular theater dimming their projectors is already bad enough, but to pay for the IMAX experience and get a dim screen is just disappointing to the max.

Anyway, there have been articles written about theaters purposely dimming their projector bulbs in an attempt to save money. I think the idea is that the less power a projector bulb is using, the longer the bulb will last, hence saving the theater money by not having to replace projector bulbs as frequently as they did before the pandemic started (of course, covid hit theaters pretty hard, so it makes sense that now they‚Äôre doing everything they can to try and save money).

The dim screens in theaters nowadays has really been a bummer and turned me off from wanting to go back to the theaters in general. I *love* going out to the movies, but if the experience continues to be this way, I think I‚Äòll end up going out to the movies less and less over time. It‚Äôs a shame what these companies are doing just to cut costs, and at the expense of its customers, too, at that - but it is what it is I guess.

My friend wants to go watch Batman next and we‚Äôre both weary of dim screens at this point. Hopefully the new theater we go to won‚Äôt have the same problems. Who knows, maybe this year‚Äôs Batman film really is just dim due to editing and not projector bulbs.",1647175533.0,False,-2,False

I've only started really making comics around Feb this year as an outlet for the way the pandemic has affected us all. I've been told by people that I have a funny bone (as I hopefully we all do) and that my art is good enough to show to the world. Didn't really think too much of it but one day I did start drawing a few comics and the reception I got was so nice that I thought why not commit to this. 

Anyways, I guess my opinion is biased as one of the people causing the issues but from what I have observed, the kind of response and discussion I have received posting here has eclipsed what I get at either r/comics or r/webcomics (the latter being basically dead sometimes). I may not be the funniest person over here and there are certainly people who have their humor dialed a certain way but funny is subjective and we are all just trying to find a way to make people laugh. I suppose comics was a way to do that. 

I support this rule if that's what everyone agrees upon, but I rely on the feedback I get here to make my work better the next time around. Heck, I was about to post a comic as I'm typing out this message, but I respect the rules of the subreddit.

As I got close to these narrow boats I spotted the woman walking away from me, so I jumped off the bike, grabbed my camera and snapped off one frame, not really having a chance to think about the composition or anything else, I just thought the lady looked interesting walking into the fog.

That was it, I put the camera away, got back on my bike and went to work, not really thinking about it again until a few days later when I went to load my pictures from several different days worth of shooting including that one shot into Lightroom.

It was only as I started to edit this shot that I thought it looked pretty good and liked the composition and everything around the lady, and it all seemed to work to a certain editing style, so I went with it and this picture is the result. I was quite surprised and happy how it turned out

This instrument is a model 1193 with a low C, a soloist instrument seen in almost every major symphony orchestra worldwide.  
  
Typically images of small spaces like this are mostly out of focus, due to the properties of optics at this magnification. To make it sharp from front to back I shot 82 individual frames, slowly moving the focus from front to back, then combined them in some astonishing software called Helicon Focus Stacker. The result tricks the brain into thinking it's looking at a very large space.  
  
**Helicon Focus Stacker is made by a small team in Ukraine. If you're into macro photography I suggest giving it a try and maybe even buying a copy. It's a small way to support people going through a pretty extreme situation at the moment.**

pics,i0h2upu,t3_tcusas,t3_tcusas,True,"A lot of people don't realize this, but the [red wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_wolf) is a uniquely American species of wolf and one of the most endangered canids in the world right now.  There's only ~10 of them known to be left in the wild, all in North Carolina.  There are another ~200 or so scattered across the US in various zoos and sanctuaries as part of a captive breeding program.

They were also one of the first animals to be successfully protected and reintroduced into the wild by the Endangered Species Act.  A number of wolves were reintroduced into North Carolina in the late 80's and 90's, and the population rose to more than a hundred wolves by 2012.  Sadly, in the past decade, pretty much all that progress was lost after the US Fish and Wildlife service essentially stopped all effort to protect them.  Since then, the wild population crashed down to the number it is now.  [Only a lawsuit in 2018](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/11/05/federal-judge-blasts-fish-wildlife-service-says-endangered-wolves-cannot-be-shot/) managed to reverse this trend, although the number of red wolves in the wild remains critically low even after reintroductions have restarted.

Unfortunately, there are a number of challenges that face red wolves, which have made recovery difficult.  First, there's an ongoing debate over whether or not they're a unique species or simply a wolf/coyote hybrid.  Most recent studies lean towards them having enough genetic differences to be considered a distinct species, but all animals in the *canis* genus are so closely related that they can interbreed to some extent.  Unfortunately, detractors point to the possibility that they are hybrids as a reason to strip them of ESA protections.

Another issue is the coyotes themselves -- coyotes began moving into North Carolina in the 90's, and now that they're here, there's an issue with red wolf/coyote interbreeding.  Studies ([such as the one featured in this webinar](https://youtu.be/Xon-kwBbLZ8?list=PLY0EGiGEjIMeyLciynfx0IlV1frMmiUQB&t=1698)) have shown that red wolves generally prefer to mate with other red wolves, but they are willing to pair up with coyotes if there aren't other wolves around.  With their numbers dropping precipitously and the USFWS ceasing all attempts at coyote management, there's a strong risk that the remaining wolves may be pressured into mating with coyotes.

And thirdly, the biggest issue is simply people.  The most common cause of death for red wolves is getting shot or run over by cars.  Locals often mistake them for coyotes and shoot them during hunting season.  Some even shoot them intentionally.  And the primary reason the USFWS stopped supporting the recovery program was due to local pressure by anti-wolf activists.",1647162977.0,False,2,False

However, data shows that relative to the percentage of the population they represent, **the rate of black American deaths from police shootings is ~2.5-3x that of white Americans deaths**. (Sources: [1](https://i.redd.it/7bf1lsrmyu251.jpg), [2](https://www.statista.com/chart/21857/people-killed-in-police-shootings-in-the-us/), Data: [1](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings))

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

If after learning the above, you have reconsidered your stance and wish to show support for furthering equality in this and other areas, we encourage you to do so. However if you plan on attending any protests, please remember to stay safe, wear a face mask, and observe distancing protocols as much as you can.
