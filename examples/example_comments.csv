I grew up in Corpus Christi, TX, right on the coast, and the difference between wet cold and dry cold is usually just a couple degrees. Freezing cold, the water falls out of the air and you can be comfortably warm with a decent jacket or coat. Once the thermometer hits 35F you just can't get warm. It's like...layers of sweaters, plus coat, plus extra socks, the bed gets all the blankets and it doesn't matter because you're still fucking cold. 

I went to Canada over Christmas one year and hiked around Lake Louise for hours. One coat, one sweater, long underwear my hosts provided and it was *fantastic*. My breath froze in my hair and it just didn't feel cold. I came home, got off the plane and was like...fuck, can I go back to Canada? I was *warm* there.",1641424463.0,False,6.0,False
funny,hret1w6,t3_rwsq0k,t1_hrep39c,False,"Yes.  Same thing, other extreme.  You move here, you buy a snow blower because it works quite well with the powdery snow.  Well, actually shoveling generally goes faster too.  The snow is lighter.  That wet snow out in the East is soooo heavy.  Anyhow, though I grew up with it, when I go back to visit, the humidity during the summer gets to me.  I do wilt.  (And NEVER  had AC- Dad was too cheap!  In the west, the heat is like an oven, instead of a sauna.  The (only?) good thing about dry heat is in the shade, you can really discern the temperature difference- it really is cooler.  I can be comfortable in a higher degree of dry heat, than with the same degree, but with humidity.  However, my relatives visiting from the East actually have a harder time.  Guess it’s also easier to dehydrate here.  I’ve heard that anyway.  I’ve been here long enough that a water bottle is a staple and don’t think much about it any more.",1641420162.0,False,4.0,False
funny,hrf5vb9,t3_rwsq0k,t1_hrep39c,False,"There is, but it's not quite as discernible as wet and dry heat. Humidity is generally listed as *relative* because warm air retains more moisture than cold air. So 100% humidity at 20°F is not the same moisture content in the air as 100% humidity at 80°F.

In freezing high humidity, moisture can't evaporate so well and you'll see frost start forming in beards. But similar to getting out of a pool in the Summer, evaporation in dry cold will make you feel colder than the generally-reported (dry-bulb) air temperature. This effect is referred to as the wet-bulb temperature, and both the moisture you exhale clinging to your face and perspiration evaporating from your skin will make those exposed areas feel that much colder.

Then comes the wind chill factor which is convective heat transfer, basically the constant battery of cold air siphoning the heat away from your body like a heat sink on a CPU.",1641424992.0,False,3.0,False

My SO and I both believed that the mattress would be rolled up and vacuum packaged. It was even on their website (package dimension of 150 x 40 cm). According to my measurements, that would have fit! The bedframe itself (picked up yesterday from another store) did fit!

I've only started really making comics around Feb this year as an outlet for the way the pandemic has affected us all. I've been told by people that I have a funny bone (as I hopefully we all do) and that my art is good enough to show to the world. Didn't really think too much of it but one day I did start drawing a few comics and the reception I got was so nice that I thought why not commit to this. 

Anyways, I guess my opinion is biased as one of the people causing the issues but from what I have observed, the kind of response and discussion I have received posting here has eclipsed what I get at either r/comics or r/webcomics (the latter being basically dead sometimes). I may not be the funniest person over here and there are certainly people who have their humor dialed a certain way but funny is subjective and we are all just trying to find a way to make people laugh. I suppose comics was a way to do that. 

I support this rule if that's what everyone agrees upon, but I rely on the feedback I get here to make my work better the next time around. Heck, I was about to post a comic as I'm typing out this message, but I respect the rules of the subreddit.

I own a civic so we strapped it to the top of my moms car,… (since it wouldn’t go into the cargo area diagonally). She has an Acura RSX and Amazon made me think box would fit as it was 6’ x 4’ x 8”, and the dimensions listed for the Acura lex me to believe it would go in easy.  

Amazon had a “your shipment is delayed ‘indefinitely’” email sent on the day of delivery so we got a year newer model in town. Amazon said they had one left and the transaction went through so idk what their deal was. They had just emailed and were like “so y’all wanna cancel?” I seem to get patterns of good things for me never working out so I was just like let’s find one local.  

Anyway, I went to put the stand on which I made sure was a center mount (instead of those dual-prong “feet” they seem to put on every new tv) since my existing table is smaller and not that wide. Anyway, I couldn’t get the screws into the tv when trying to thread them through the stand. The directions said to lay tv flat but for various reasons I don’t have that kind of floor space or flat surface, so my gf had to come all the way from her city miles away to help me hold the tv to put 4 screws in. We layed one end on my small table, she held the other and I put the screws in real fast like. Idk why they wouldn’t go in when I had the tv in a vertical position with a corner resting on my foot, they went through the stand but wouldn’t catch the threads inside the tv.

Gotta love all the mandate loving fake woke bs on here. All in the name of ""public health."" Normal people with half a brain are pissed about the mandates, lockdowns, internment camps, harassment and the monopoly on violence. ""Show me your papers"" going on all over the world. Canada is using it's military to forcefully vaccinate people in Quebec. Refusing to give up the broken narrative because it's easier to virtue signal in their bubbles than to face the inconvenient truth. This was never/will never be about public health

Npcs and bots with little to no knowledge of history, blatantly ignoring all the signs of the authoritarian takeover happening all over the world. But but but it's their fault I got the cold, why they don't believe the numbers that the media told us to believe? They're plague rats, they're animals, they're selfish. They should die, they shouldn't be allowed in society anymore. I wonder if there's any historical precedent for this hmmmmmmm I wonder. 

The whole woke movement is bullshit. It's just another way for the elites to divide people, give everyone their own soap box to bitch about their personal problems so that no one will unite against the crimes against humanity currently being perpetrated by the powers that be. Everyone wants to be a nice, caring, sensitive person, but only in a fake way online so they can take credit for it while not being required to really do anything about it. 

Wokeness/individualism is a cancer, not unlike institutional racism. The crimes are happening under democrat rule. There are no parties in the u.s., only one govt and big businesses that all serve the same interests. The ""shareholders."" They are all the same people. The best subjects are angry, divided, and distracted. Don't be a serf.

In 1980, Saddam Hussein invaded Iran and waged an 8 year long war that resulted in a million dead and included Saddam’s use of chemical weapons against the Iranians.

The People’s Mojahedin of Iran is an Islamic-Marxist cult that was based in Iraq during this time period. During the Iran-Iraq War, they fought for Saddam and took up arms against their fellow Iranians. In 1988, after Iran and Iraq had already agreed to a ceasefire, the PMOI invaded Iran again and razed a small village of 15,000 people to the ground, then attempted to capture the city of Kermanshah. The Iranian military fucked them up really bad and then executed a bunch of them.

I find it strange how we can also, simultaneously, protect a woman's supposed 'right' to terminate her unborn child. It sounds like a contradiction in terms. 

Abortion is the removal of a living entity!

The unborn child is made up of multiple human cells and has human DNA separate & distinct from that of its mother. The child is wholly different from its mother. It is human life by all possible definitions. It is a human being and therefore deserves the same rights as any other human being.

You seem to be making the argument that the ZEF is like a parasite. The mother (or host as she is sometimes referred to) created the dependent life in question. The unborn child is NOT a parasite! It did not find a random host to feed on! The unborn child's life and its 'right-to-life' were NOT without the expressed consent of the mother. The mother created that new life willingly, willfully, 'on her own accord' & fully aware of the possible outcome.

I believe that a woman should have the absolute right in deciding whether or not to CREATE new life. In contrast, I believe that a woman should NOT have the absolute right in deciding whether or not to END that same newly created (& separate) life that is 'alive' inside of her.

The only rationale given to ""Pro-Life"" is religion or ignorance - not a fair representation, and patronizing.  This statement ignores the simple philosophical consideration of where life begins, which is central and obvious.

Also, it's not great that the mods posted links to arguments for one side only.  (Although I'm not going to search for a counter-balance article at the moment.)

Abortion is a challenging issue, and weighing in on it takes balance and judgment.  We should *not* pretend that there is a legitimate disagreement when there is none - i.e. climate change.  It is perfectly okay to describe a position as totally stupid, if it really is so.

It is not acceptable to ignore disagreement when it is legitimate, attributing one side to ""ignorance"", when that is not a good diagnosis.  Remember, there are dumb people on both sides of most debates - pointing them out is a waste of time (and an ad hominem).

1. a woman having a period with a fertilized egg is not murder

The issue is that we don't agree at what point in between the unborn child deserves human rights. Science can't answer this question for us, it's a philosophical/moral question - and as such very subjective.

The idea that (using the UK limits for simplicity) a foetus at 23 weeks 6 days and 23 hours old is in any way significantly different from a 24 week old, is so clearly wrong as to be laughable. Same applies for the age requirement for drinking or gambling or such. It's one area that I actually think the pro-life crowd have a better argument: a heartbeat or brain activity makes far more sense than an arbitrary number of days since conception.

The other thing that I believe the pro-choice crowd get wrong is destigmatising or even celebrating abortion. Abortion (in most cases) is the lesser of two evils, but it is still evil/bad. You are having to kill *something*, because of your decision to have sex. As above, that *something* is not yet a legal person, but it would become one if you didn't abort/kill it.

I believe the vast majority of the population want abortion to be legal (most certainly in cases of incest, rape, deformities, or when the mother's life is in danger), with stringent restrictions and a social stigma. I believe that pushing for fewer restrictions, or to destigmatise abortion is a losing strategy to keeping abortion legal - same way pushing for seizing the means of production is the enemy of getting corporations to pay more tax. By going to the logical extreme (or standing shoulder to shoulder with those extremists), you alienate the majority of the public.

The crux of the debate is around the phrase *her body*. Pro-choice people believe that an abortion is something the woman does to her own body. Pro-life people believe that it's something she does to someone else's body. They believe that the fetus is a separate person, deserving like any other person of having their human rights protected by the government.

This is why court cases generally revolve around the question of fetal viability. There has to exist some line where the fetus changes from ""part of the mother's body"" into ""a human"", and I don't think you'll find many people who'll say that that line is the exact moment of birth. *Roe* defined it as the third trimester; *Casey* defined it as viability; extreme anti-abortionists believe it's the moment of conception. Republican lawmakers have been trying for years to define it as various arbitrary milestones like when the fetus can respond to pain or when a heartbeat can be detected.

It's a difficult and messy question, since there's no single moment you can point to and say ""this is when life begins"", and because both sides are so entrenched at this point that the conversation is loaded with buzzwords and political grandstanding more than any attempt at rational argument.

Whilst I agree with the sentiment, and basic idea that pregnancy as a result of rape is massively different to pregnancy by voluntary sex, I think it is interesting and important that you're talking %.

Blackstone's ratio is one of the principles of common law, ""It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer."" - meaning that the exceptions must be *at least* 10% or fewer of the cases. This is also why the feminist argument about the low conviction rate of rape accusations is no argument at all - presumption of innocence, and the standard for conviction being beyond reasonable doubt are fundamental cornerstones of justice.

I would suggest that a compromise would be that in order to qualify for an abortion due to rape, the woman must both file a police report and sworn affidavit - as opposed to simply saying to the medical team that they were raped. That way, if the woman is provably lying, they will be punished for wasting police time and perjury - but if there simply isn't enough evidence for conviction (as there often isn't) then there is no punishment.

>""Human life is a living entity with human DNA."" I believe that the existence of human life (or unborn human child) happens at conception.

You misunderstand, I am calling the one extra day the mild inconvenience. The tragedy was the mother choosing not to have an abortion early on, and instead choosing to carry the brainless child to the day before birth.

>late-term abortions (>24 weeks) make up only 1% of US abortions. I feel it would be a rare person to get to that stage for whom the baby isn't wanted and wished for, apart from the obvious rape/abuse/no access to abortion until then.

Then perhaps what is needed is an exception process. If the unborn child has a heartbeat/brain activity (whatever objective measure is decided), then a panel of doctors and judges (or some other group of socially-power-endowed people with knowledge/expertise on the medical *and* moral side of things).

An issue for pro-lifers, and even those of us who think abortion should be legal and readily available, are the minority of women who will abuse the legality of abortion. Those who after a fight with their partner, get an abortion to spite them. Those who use abortion as contraception. Those deranged activists who celebrate abortions. They are the target for the vast majority of people calling for more restrictions on abortion - not rape victims, not women carrying children with deformities, etc.

It is not beyond the wit of man to come up with ways to target one group and not the other.

My final point often gets called sex-negative or victim blaming or anti-woman, but it's none of those things - it is basic reason: if you don't want a baby, don't have sex. This applies to both men and women. If you don't want a hangover, don't drink. If you don't want to get fat, don't eat so much.

Abortion ends the life of the unborn child... The mother's offspring. It is akin to murder. There was a story near where I lived where a father killed his 4 and 6-year-old daughters on Christmas day (https://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.ctvnews.ca/local/british-columbia/2019/12/19/1_4737124.html).

Abortion is also ""an extreme physical and emotional stress""... I don't think one is more or less stressful than the other. Not enough is said about the mental effects it has. My mother, over 50 years later, still ponders over what her child would have been like had it been born. It's almost akin to a miscarriage... Perhaps worse.

>How do I define human life?...

""Human life is a living entity with human DNA."" I believe that the existence of human life (or unborn human child) happens at conception. In other words, the moment DNA exists which is separate from that of the mother. Abortion is the removal of a living entity!

An amoeba, an organism made up of only one cell, is still alive. It is life. If NASA had found any life as small as an amoeba on Mars or the moon, they would claim that they had found alien life. The unborn child is just as alive as an amoeba. The unborn child is made up of multiple human cells and has human DNA separate & distinct from that of its mother. The child is wholly different from its mother. It is human life by all possible definitions. It is a human being and therefore deserves the same rights as any other human being.",1639895990.0,False,5.0,False

pics,hpaxk6h,t3_rh25ex,t1_hp547k3,False,"In my eyes, being raped was just an example, it isn't the only exception- there are women who get abortions because they cannot care for their children and their country's foster care system is completely inadequate. There are women who get them because they can get pregnant, but it's too risky for then to carry it to term. There are girls who are too young to have children (some girls can get pregnant at 10 years old, but that's just not safe- just because their uterus can form a baby does not mean their body is fully ready to support it. There is an instance of a girl giving birth at 5 years old. It may not be common, but it does happen.) There are some women who are addicts and cannot quit, but would rather not subject their child to fetal alcohol syndrome (and ""just quitting drinking"" isn't always an option.) There are some women who are getting too old to safely have children, there are men whose pregnancies will interrupt gender transition, there are some people with a family or personal history of pregnancy complications, and there are so many more reasons why someone may seek an abortion. I think the primary response to all of these should be better contraceptive access and sex education- I'm no pro abortion, I want that on the table. However, even in instances where contraceptives are available, there are times they fail, and I think abortion should be available. I think abortion should be the last possible resort, but I think it should be available.

There was a post I saw in this sub. It was the photo of a memorial for a woman who died of septic shock because she was miscarrying, but denied an abortion while the fetus still had a heartbeat. I think abortion should be available for women like her.

I think abortion should not be common. I think it should be a last possible resort. I think we would see significantly less demand for abortions if we had better  foster care, more protections for sexual abuse victims, better sexual education, more contraceptive access, more accessible healthcare for pregnant women and addicts, etc.- however, I think abortion is such a complex topic that any kind of blanket ban is going to fail to take *something* into consideration. And, more than anything, I think it's important to remember that people who are determined enough to have abortions will get them one way or another and I would much rather have those people go to clinics than do it with a coat hanger.

I think fetuses have value as living creatures; however, in the cases where an abortion is neccessary, I think consciousness adds a level of humanness that fetuses don't have. That is why I think we should try and *prevent* abortions. They should be a last case resort for when the pregnancy is threatening the mother's well being or when the child will have a miserable standard of living should they be born.

I think comparing a fetus to an amoeba is unfair- yes both are life in the scientific sense, but not in the philosophical sense. If a fetus, an adult human, and an ameoba have the same value, that would make hand sanitizer a form of murder, because viruses are as well.

pics,hr5ixge,t3_rh25ex,t1_hr4fp7d,False,"*Modus tollens* is an interesting claim. In order to evaluate this, we need to reconstruct your argument, because it was presented implicitly (which is fine; it's an effective presentation of the style of argument you were attempting to make):

The structure of the argument is *If A, then B* and you have taken my words, inverted the values of certain phrases(""A""), and presented it as the totality of your argument (""B""). In a good use of this, we could conclude that there was nothing of interest in my original argument (because relying on equally valid premises, we could reach the opposite conclusion).

One good reason to reject your use of this is that you lack a solid ground for conferring the rights of personhood upon a fetus, in particular one which is not yet capable of living outside the womb. Since this is the key premise of the logical argument that abortion is morally equivalent to murder, it's a pretty big problem. You can't simply state it to be the case, or rely on common language or linguistics. There are clear-cut, relevant, salient differences between a live human being, outside the womb, and one which has the potential to become that, but is not yet viable. *If* you could establish this 1:1 relationship (the crux of my original statement) you would have a very strong case to outlaw all abortions.

But more relevant to *modus tollens* here is I'm not rejecting that you could invalidate my claim, or render it meaningless (*therefore not B*). I'm rejecting that you have *established A*, and as a result you cannot use the rest of your argument to *prove B*. *Not A, therefore not B* is a fallacy, but *Not A therefore you haven't proven anything* is not a fallacy.

To the rest of what you say:

If I wanted to establish a right to late-term abortions (most obviously, beyond the point of viability), I would definitely need to address your issue of age, or support a claim that women's right to their body or medical privacy was primary vs. right to life. I'm not terribly interested in that argument. In fact I might even agree with you, beyond the point of viability.

My original issue is that your position, depending how you frame it, is an appeal to authority (God /Bible) which has no external validity, or as ""begging the question"" or as reliance on a false premise.

This is what I said in the first place, and you haven't addressed it at all, you've simply doubled down. I've never said you can't hold that opinion, because, of course, if you accept the Bible as the literal word of God, and God as real (which I can't disprove, and don't need to) then your position is consistent. However, it's very ""illuminating"" that you would respond to an acknowledgement of your sincerely held beliefs, by insisting that you ""know"" those things to be true.

Tell me, how do you know those things, in a framework that justifies imposing that knowledge on others, and passing judgement based on that knowledge?

PS: if you're going to quote something and complain about it being a ""poor phrase"", don't paraphrase: ""establish this by a means other than simply stating it"" is very clear; if you want to use the premise, and you know it is not already accepted, you will need to address the reasons it is not accepted, otherwise you are arguing from a false premise.",1641259739.0,False,-1.0,False

I think there's a big difference between a woman who wants an abortion because she was raped and/or because her country does not have an adequate foster system versus, say, a woman who did it because she wanted a boy instead of a girl or because she doesn't want a child with down syndrome.

And I would agree that, in order to ban abortion, there needs to be better access to contraceptives. I would add that, in my opinion, before the government starts placing abortion bans in place, they need to take care of living people. For example, in some cases it is possible to know before birth if a child is going to be disabled. I would expect that the decision on whether or not to terminate that pregnancy would rely heavily on her country's healthcare and social security programs. I also think that, in order to ban abortion, there has to be adequate foster care, etc.

With what I know about abortion, I would not make any blanket statements as to whether or not it should be legal. However, I do think there are a lot more nuances to the discussion than whether or not the sex was consensual, and I think there are too many nuances for a government to take all of them into consideration when deciding when to ban abortions.

As for the ""two wrongs don't make a right"" argument, I would have to disagree. I agree that two wrongs don't make a right, however, I would not necessarily say abortion is always wrong. Pregnancy is already an extreme physical and emotional stress (generally- of course some are easier or harder than others.) In the case of sexual assault, it is extremely traumatic, and I do not think it is right for the government to participate in traumatizing its citizens like this.

As I've noted, you can't actually abort when you get that late (38-39 weeks), and they have to induce labor. Also, defects of the complex nervous system often aren't spotted until relatively late in pregnancy because it's the *complex* nervous system--it develops relatively late in an of itself.

> ...the minority of women who will abuse the legality of abortion. Those who after a fight with their partner, get an abortion to spite them. Those who use abortion as contraception. Those deranged activists who celebrate abortions.

Too much here to really discuss, but 1) while I *do* know there are callous women in the world, their reason for having an abortion is IMO no one's business, and 2) I don't agree that all the people you list are ""abusing"" the availability of abortion.

> They are the target for the vast majority of people calling for more restrictions on abortion - not rape victims, not women carrying children with deformities, etc.

At least in American discussions about this, I've noticed that the predominant framing of these things is ""it's murder"" and that women who want abortions *in general* are callous. Contraception and sex education are also targeted, so that woman not only don't have access to ways to prevent pregnancy, but to know they *can* prevent it. This also combines with healthcare access in general, as targeted by the American right-wing.

> if you don't want a baby, don't have sex

I do, in fact, think this is an anti-women talking point. For one, contraceptives *fail*, even the best ones: I have an IUD, but still a very very very very rare chance of getting pregnant with an ectopic pregnancy, which is fatal for both fetus and the person carrying it.

Two, [look at the demographics of women getting abortions](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/characteristics-us-abortion-patients-2014#) in the US. 59% of them had already given birth, so they're hardly callous about having children. But, furthermore:

> In 2014, three-fourths of abortion patients were low income—49% living at less than the federal poverty level, and 26% living at 100–199% of the poverty level.
> 
> ...
> 
> Abortion patients were less likely to have no health insurance coverage in 2014 than in 2008 (28% vs. 34%), likely because of the Affordable Care Act. Thirty-five percent of patients had Medicaid coverage...

Access to healthcare (incl. contraception) and *having money* allow people to avoid abortions. Studies indicate [40% of women](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6874-13-29) in the US seek an abortion for financial reasons (and 29% have the reason that they need to focus on their other children). When you say ""don't have sex"" to what is basically a bunch of poorer women, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Partner related reasons accounted for 31% of abortions in the above study, so you know at least 31% of them have (or have had) a partner, and probably more.

It feels extremely callous to me to say ""do not have sex with your partner, even with contraception, if you aren't 100 prepared for a baby"" to, well, pretty much every non-lesbian woman on Earth. No one is ever 100% prepared for these things and there's always a small chance of pregnancy--just as there's a chance of injury and worse every time you choose to drive a car.

Edit 2: Whoever thinks the civil war wasn't about slavery, see below:

On January 7, 1861, the ordinance signed in Montgomery that “it is the desire and purpose of the people of Alabama to meet the Slaveholding States of the South, who may approve such purpose, in order to frame a provisional as well as permanent government upon the principles of the Constitution of the United States.”

On February 2, 1861, Texas declared its decision to be “based upon the unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color—a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of the Divine Law.”

On March 9, 1861, Arkansas’s George B. Smoote added a resolution: “Resolved, that the platform on the party known as the Black Republican Party contains unconstitutional dogmas, dangerous in their tendency and highly derogatory to the rights of slave states, and among them the insulting, injurious and untruthful enunciation of the right of the African race of their country to social and political equality with the whites.”

On April 17, 1861 latecomer Virginia, provoked by Lincoln’s raising troops to suppress the already seceded states, declared “Lincoln’s opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery” as it cut ties with Washington. Tennessee was the 11th and last, its population divided on secession (eastern Tennesseans generally opposed it), but not on the slave issue.",1641396138.0,False,439.0,False

Honestly, though, I'm just going to plug a few of Wikipedia's sister projects (i.e. also run by the Wikimedia Foundation) whose editors don't really get a lot of credit like Wikipedia does:

* [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) – en.wiktionary.org is an every-language-to-English dictionary/thesaurus/etymology guide (likewise, fr.wiktionary.org is every-language-to-French, etc.). So for example, if I look up the word ['no'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/no), I can find out what it means in 61 different languages. Or if I wanted to know what ['水'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B0%B4) means, I could do that too. It's my go-to dictionary since I think I've only found a few archaic words that aren't there.

* [Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Main_Page) – Wikipedia but in the form of a travel guide. Want to learn what to do while you're on the Moon? [No problem.](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Moon)

* [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) – Contains almost 80,000,000 media files ranging from Creative Commons to public domain.

* [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page) – Has over 500,000 texts that can be downloaded as e-books and PDFs, copy-pasted, listened to through text-to-speech, etc.

* [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page) – Contains quotes from certain people and media and about certain topics. Want to see if [Albert Einstein actually said it?](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) Certainly not every quote is there, but it'll at least help you gauge whether or not he did (plus, Wikiquote catalogues disputed and misattributed quotes, making this even easier).

Later you find the dossier in the Thalmor embassy on Ulfric, essentially saying he is working for them accidentally and that they shouldn't interfere in the civil war unless it is essential to keep it going.

Then theres the fact that Ulfric is just a straight up selfish narcissistic asshole - he lets his own citizens in his city rot in the grey quarter, seems to have zero patience for anyone that isn't a nord, on his side and sniffing his ass on the daily - will kill anyone and everything that disagrees.

He also murdered the high king without even talking to him - if you talk to members of the court in Solitude they essentially say that the high king respected Ulfric and possibly would've stood up to the Empire if Ulfric asked him to - but because Ulfric doesn't really care about that sort of thing and just wants to be high king, he skipped all that and just murdered the guy who didn't stand a chance against him.

Picking the empire feels bad simply because they have you almost executed for literally no reason at the start of the game (which feels very gamey to me) and because the Thalmor are slightly aligned with them, if only in text. The Stormcloaks on the other hand are just straight up racist lunatics, with a dictator narcissist at the helm. Theres also zero chance Ulfric is fighting and defeating the Thalmor, so if he wins and beats the Empire in Skyrim, he has just weakened the empire, the thalmor crush them, then the thalmor march north and crush the Stormcloaks too.

The Empire is the lesser of two evils, where one evil is a 2 out of 10 and the other is a 8 or 9 out of 10.

pics,hrf1xzs,t3_rwojjh,t1_hrdng8h,False,"> The findings of the investigation stated that the B‑2 crashed after ""heavy, lashing rains"" caused moisture to enter skin-flush air-data sensors. The data from the sensors are used to calculate numerous factors including airspeed and altitude. Because three pressure transducers failed to function[13]—attributable to condensation inside devices, not a maintenance error—the flight-control computers calculated inaccurate aircraft angle of attack and airspeed. Incorrect airspeed data on cockpit displays led to the aircraft rotating at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph) slower than indicated. After the wheels lifted from the runway, which caused the flight control system to switch to different control laws, the erroneously sensed negative angle of attack caused the computers to inject a sudden, 1.6 g (16 m/s2), uncommanded 30-degree pitch-up maneuver. The combination of slow lift-off speed and the extreme angle of attack, with attendant drag, resulted in an unrecoverable stall, yaw, and descent. Both crew members successfully ejected from the aircraft soon after the left wing tip started to gouge the ground alongside the runway. The aircraft hit the ground, tumbled, and burned after its fuel ignited.[2][7][14][15]

That's just one example in entertainment media of the concept around rewriting history... in any direction good or bad.  I don't know what is worse... seeing it actually happen going in a comically tragic direction, or that enough of us should have seen it coming based on the number of movies and books that have shown us examples of how rewriting history is generally a bad thing when human beings are involved.

What happens when a generation is taught this?  I'm not talking about leaving things out of history class.. like not talking about race riots that killed thousands... that's bad enough, but teaching students HOW to access the information that is available can increase the numbers of students who learn about these buried historical events through research projects, term paper assignments, etc... at least that can keep that kind of history from being lost.  This kind of BS?  This is something different.  And dangerous.

It isn't just the erroneous conclusion, but the way the student is being taught to arrive at this conclusion.  The student isn't allowed to question the presence of ""surviving"", aka non-decomposed dinosaur tissue.  It is the single most important piece of information pointing in a specific direction as to what the ""truth"" must be... and it is presented as a carved-in-stone, unquestionable fact.

My wife is type 1 diabetic so medical insurance is a must for us and at that late in the year we had already got our max of of pocket of 10k. We received all the paperwork but we were fortunate to have everything covered. 

We received 2 itemized bills. The first was for all equipment and medicine, total amount was ~$250k. The second bill was for all the doctors and that was ~$100k. Total right around ~$350k. 

My wife shouldn't have lived. She had an antibiotic resistant e coli infection and everything moved so fast they didn't have time to let the tests finish because of how bad it was going and made a guess with a targeted medicine. It was the only one that would have saved her. She's literally a miracle to survive. We are still recovering today as it has caused damage to the heart, lungs, and brain and severe PTSD. But she's still here so we keep going forward. 

Sorry this got a bit longer than I thought, even 3 years later and it still makes me emotional thinking about it all. Hug your loved one and cherish the time you have today! Stay safe everyone!",1641401192.0,False,57.0,False

That's a good question.  I didn't either.  The induction (which could be wrong) was based on:

1) They posted the earliest version of the image I could find.

2) They posted the highest quality version of the image that I could find.  

3) They [appear to have](https://www.reddit.com/r/HermanCainAward/comments/rwfywt/an_unvaxxed_patient_on_a_rotoprone_bed_and/hrbnpde/) [knowledge](https://www.reddit.com/r/HermanCainAward/comments/rwfywt/an_unvaxxed_patient_on_a_rotoprone_bed_and/hrbql0v/?context=3) about this that only someone there could have.

> And this OP u/thenewyorkgod
 is the Moderator of several subreddits. That doesn't seem to fit the profile of ""karma-farming bots"" that you are trying to go after. And they have been an active Redditor just like you for 9 years...
Does u/thenewyorkgod
 fit your profile of ""karma-farming bots""???

Since I never called /u/thenewyorkgod a karma-farming bot or implied that they were, I have no idea where this accusation is coming from.

I've [mentioned before](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/878r4a/a_monk_prays_for_an_elderly_man_who_had_died/dwbpbhj/) that I usually do one of two things.  First, provide context, attribution, sources, and higher resolution images when possible.  Why?  Ever notice how many threads are dominated by unnecessary arguing and speculation because of misinformation or the absence of information? I figured it's easy enough to do, so why not help to ameliorate this where I can?  

Second, I hunt karma-farming bots.  A long time ago I started to see how much they hurt reddit and its users.  If you're not familiar with them or how they hurt reddit, [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/3jss04/meta_spammers_how_they_work_and_how_to_spot_them/) is a great introduction.  Again, I figured why not help where I can?  

**TLDR:** I like reddit and I like people.  Helping both is rewarding.

pics,hrdimhm,t3_rwlnhu,t1_hrdbt57,False,"The machine in the picture helps turn the patient on to their belly (“prone position”, hence “RotaProne bed”). That position helps the lungs work more efficiently, but leaving a patient in one position leads to pressure ulcers and other problems. The bed makes it much easier to turn patients regularly. 

The comment about damaging alveoli is about artificial ventilation in general. If you’re at the point of being put on a ventilator, it’s because your lungs are so damaged that you’re not getting enough oxygen without it. Ventilators are very configurable, but even with the best possible settings, forcing enough air for survival into already damaged lungs can damage them further. This is a known adverse effect of the treatment, just like medications have side effects. 

Choosing a treatment involves weighing the benefits and risks. A lot of work has gone in to figuring out best lung protective ventilator settings, and when the best time to start invasive ventilation is to minimise the adverse effects and maximise the benefits, but even the best possible settings and timing aren’t enough for patients with severe lung damage. 

tl;dr: the machines don’t kill people, they’re used when the disease has already reached the point where the patient would soon dead without ventilation. Ventilation has risks, including additional lung damage, so it’s only used when the benefits outweigh the risks.",1641402183.0,False,48.0,False

It is most often done when they are very sick but it is beneficial in even mild to moderate cases of covid. We often encourage moderately I’ll covid patients to “self-prone” (meaning they put themselves in that position).

It takes at least 5 staff to prone a patient, one of those being a respiratory therapist. However we often use 7 or 8 people. Three nurses/or techs on each side of the patient and 1-2 respiratory therapists to manage the ET tube (breathing tube). The majority of the nurses/tech are doing the coordinated flip while at least one is managing the lines (iv’s, arterial line, feeding tube, drains, etc). Very sick patients have a ton of iv medications going simultaneously and need a lot of iv access so there can be 8-12 iv tubing stretching from the iv pole to the various iv access points. These patient will also have a foley catheter (for urine) and a dignicare (tube inserted into rectum to drain stool).

It’s a lot to manage but everyone works together. It only takes a few minute to do but the patient’s primary nurse is responsible to get everything prepped prior to everyone coming in the room. The nurse takes the ekg leads off the chest (don’t want the patient to lay on them when they are proned), organizes the iv tubing/arterial line/foley/feeding tube/dignicare so they  won’t be in the way. Then the nurse drapes an incontinence pad over the patients pelvic area and places a flat sheet over the patient.

pics,hres5hy,t3_rwlnhu,t1_hrelqdz,False,"This bed is called a “Roto-prone” bed. Its use is simple: when patient’s lungs get really bad (from Covid or certain other diseases), the lung walls become inflamed, very rigid/stiff, and will be filled with mucous. Healthy lungs are supposed to be like a balloon - easily expandable to allow you to breathe in, let your lungs fill with air (containing oxygen), which then goes through the soft lung walls to your blood stream to supply your whole body. When the lungs are so rigid (again, a byproduct of Covid and other diseases), they lose that elasticity and don’t allow oxygen to pass through. The point of putting the patient on the bed and rotating them is to ensure ALL lung areas are used to try to get oxygen to pass through, not just the upper areas where air (since air is lighter than mucous) normally will sit. This has moderate success, but requires a lot of planning and monitoring. The patient of course needs to be strapped in very securely, and with plenty of cushion as to not develop pressure ulcers on the skin. Secondly, all of the IV lines, the ventilator tubing/circuit, and monitoring cables must be strapped to a specific area near the head as to not get pulled while the bed is moving. The bed itself does not complete a full 360 degree turn, but rather will go almost fully to one side, and then the other.

\-Lost in translation from old Armenian to Greek/Latin: the original word used was probably the same or almost the same for virgin and holy. The same happened with the apple in the genesis (malus).  
\-Religion stealing stuff from other religions to convert the masses and keep traditions: Dionysus was born from a virgin, used to change water into wine (but not for the same meaning, once was a partygod, the other one is a parable) was born on the 25th of December (but Jesus was more probably born in spring, don't remember why but I think it has something to do with stable occupation of the animals that was impossible in winter). So instead of coming over with a brand-new god/messiah there were similarities with previous religions. Similar: we make crepes on Candlemas because Helios was the sungod and we revered him by making crepes and similar. And there was also something with Ceres (agricultural god celebrated just before spring at the same time) linked to that. ""So hey, why bother with multiple pagan gods when you just can have our holy trinity and continue your same traditions? By the way, those are our traditions now, you pagan!""  
\-Hey bro! What's up bro? In some cultures everyone can be your brother, which can be frequent in the Middle East. So his brothers could be half-brothers, cousins, or even a long-time family friend that crashed all the time over.   


That's more or less it. The same priest was actually really cool and is probably going to officiate at a friends wedding.

Behemoth is an elephant. Reasons:

 - Behemoth means largest land animal. The elephant was the largest land animal at the time.
 - Behemoth's mouth gets filled with water if it is in water that's 12 feet high. All (extinct) animals larger than the elephant have their mouth higher.
 - Behemoth has a tail that moves or stiffens like a ceder. This is also true for the elephant.
 - Behemoth has a nose that can get stuck in a snare. The trunk of the elephant can get stuck in a snare.
 - Behemoth drinks water by moving the water towards his mouth. Only two animals do this: primates and elephants.
 - Behemoth has two swords pointing forward. Elephants have tusks.
 - Behemoth can breath with its mouth under water. Elephants do this as well.
 - Behemoth likes to stand underneath a lotus tree. So do elephants. The largest extinct land animals would not fit underneath a lotus tree.
 - Behemoth is a herbivore. Elephants are as well.

Some scholars disagreed that Behemoth meant animal. This is because behemoth likes to swim, and it was long thought that elephants don't like swimming. It was only later discovered that elephants do like to swim. There are no other reasons to believe that it is not an elephant.",1641394693.0,False,6.0,False

Cartridge firearms manufacturers started out producing both firearms *and proprietary ammunition.*  They saw a bigger market in the ammunition than in the weapons, and wanted their customers to have to buy only their proprietary brand.  Winchester and Colt were very jealous of their brands and would not produce firearms that used the other manufacturer's ammunition.

The 1873 Colt Peacemaker revolver was very popular on the frontier.  Colt even stamped revolvers made for the civilian market as ""Frontier Six Shooter.""  It was originally made in .45 Colt caliber, but eventually was made in numerous calibers.  The 1873 Winchester rifle was originally produced in .44 WCF (Winchester Center Fire) caliber.   It was extremely popular, and people began requesting that Colt produce revolvers in the same caliber as Winchester's rifles.  Colt did so, but named the ammunition "".44-40"" (0.44"" diameter bore with 40 grains of black powder in the case.  It was exactly the same as the .44 WCF cartridge.)

At my wits end, I put a back massager to my chest and exhaled all the way and to my surprise it actually subsided the itching quite a bit and helped me produce phlegm (gross I know).

My bronchitis went from lasting up to two weeks with lingering issues for a month or two, to lasting at most 3 days and ~a week of lingering. 

It's been about ~4 years since I've had bronchitis and I think it's because any time I get a tickle in my lungs, I use a massager and exhale to help clear it out. Anyway IANAD but it's worth it to try if you're having issues producing.
